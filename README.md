# ENGR103finalproject
Final project for ENGR 103 using arduino. Video game based off of Bop-it using the AdafruitPlayground Circuit board. Bop it inspired game, where players have to follow instructions given by the serial monitor using one of the inputs of the game. Uses button input, sound input, light input, and accelerometer. One output is the LEDS flashing green if the instructions are completed, and red if the player fails. Another output would be sound at the end of the game, playing a happy song if the player wins or a sad one if they lose. Each instruction they successfully complete would be +1 point, and each one they fail would be -1. A winning score would be 5 or more. Here are what the “instructions” would be:

“Press left button” -> press left button to gain point
“Press right button” -> press right button to gain point
“Shake it” -> shake circuit board
“Scream it” -> set off sound sensor
“Cover it” -> cover board so light sensor doesn’t pick up any light
“Press buttons” -> press both buttons at once
 Outputs are LEDs being green when u score a point or red when you lose one, and song playing depending on your score at the end.
